# Battle of Opposites

### A hackable game about roles and identity crises

Goodies vs baddies, friends vs enemies, winners vs losers: games (and life, history, wars) are simple.

In this game **you can't play alone**, so:

1. find another player
2. pick your sides (or create your *pair of opposites*)
3. start battling!
